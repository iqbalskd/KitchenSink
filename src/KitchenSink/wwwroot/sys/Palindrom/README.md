Library for two-way data binding between local JSON view models and remote, using JSON-Patch, w/ optional OT, via HTTP or WebSocket.

Implements [Server communication](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/PuppetJs/wiki/Server-communication).

For additional binding with DOM, browser history, etc. use [PalindromDOM](#PalindromDOM).

### Installation

#### You can install using [bower](http://bower.io/) and [NPM](http://npmjs.com/):

##### Bower:

```sh
bower install Palindrom --save
```

Then add source to your HTML

```html

<!-- include Palindrom bundle -->
<script src="bower_components/Palindrom/dist/palindrom.js"></script>
```
See [Dependencies section](https://github.com/Palindrom/Palindrom#dependencies) for more details.

##### NPM:

```sh
npm install palindrom --save
```

Then you can require it CommonJS or ES6/TS style:

###### CommonJS:
```js
var Palindrom = require('palindrom');
```

###### ES6/TS:
```js
import Palindrom from 'palindrom'
```

###### Or just download it manually from [github](https://github.com/Palindrom/Palindrom/archive/master.zip).

### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```js
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var palindrom = new Palindrom({remoteUrl: window.location.href});

// ..
// use palindrom.obj
palindrom.obj.someProperty = "new value";
```
* *Note 1: Please make sure you pass the correct PATCH server URL.*
* *Note 2: `palindrom.obj` is only available after `options.onStateReset` is called.*

#### Properties

```js
palindrom.property
```
Attribute             | Type       | Default                | Description
---                   | ---        | ---                    | ---

`onOutgoingPatchValidationError`   | *Function* |           | See above

* **_ Note 1: `palindrom.obj` becomes only available after `options.onStateReset` is called._**
* **_ Note 2: `palindrom.obj` is a constant (as in `const`) property, you can modify its properties but you can't assign it again or `delete` it. `palindrom.obj = {}` would throw an error._**


### Binding object once is ready (`onStateReset`)
To bind object where you need once it will be fetched from remote you can use define `onStateReset` in constructor:
```js
var palindrom = new Palindrom({remoteUrl: url, onStateReset: function (obj) {
  document.getElementById('test').model = obj;
}});
```

### Sending client changes to remote

Palindrom detects changes to the observed object synchronously. So after
```javascript
palindrom.obj.some="change";
```
The JSON Patch request will be send to the remote.

### Two-way data binding frameworks

Palindrom works superbly with frameworks that allow for two-way data binding, such as Polymer, React, Vue and Angular. These frameworks have the ability to bind an `<input>` element to a JavaScript data model in a way that the object updates after each keystroke. In consequence, Palindrom sends a patch the server after each keystroke.

If you want to opt-out from such behavior, you need to force your framework to update the data model after the element is unfocused (`blur` event). Depending on the framework:

- In Polymer 0.5 it is only possible with a Custom Element that extends the native `<input>`, similarly but not exactly how [`core-input`](https://github.com/Polymer/core-input/blob/master/core-input.html) is dome
- In Polymer 0.9+, use built-in `<input value="{{bindValue::blur}}">`
- In Angular 1.3+, use built-in `<input type="text" ng-model="name" ng-model-options="{updateOn: 'blur'}" />`

### Upgrading to WebSocket (`useWebSocket`)

You can upgrade the communication protocol to use WebSocket by setting `useWebSocket: true` option in Palindrom constructor or you can switch it at any moment by `palindrom.useWebSocket = true`.

WebSocket is a replacement for requests that would be sent using `HTTP PATCH` otherwise. The requests sent over `HTTP GET` (such as link clicks) are not affected.

:bulb: Note that this is an experimental implementation in which the WebSocket upgrade request URL taken from `X-Location` header of your first AJAX call response.

Sample:

```javascript
// enable it in constructor
var palindrom = new Palindrom({remoteUrl: url, useWebSocket: true});
// change it later via property
palindrom.useWebSocket = false;
```

### Heartbeat and reconnection

Palindrom will try to detect connection problems and then reconnect to server. If `pingIntervalS` is set it determines maximal time without network activity. When this time passes and no activity has been detected
Palindrom will issue a heartbeat patch (an empty patch, consisting only of version operations).

When connection problem is detected (e.g. there was no response to heartbeat or websocket has been closed) palindrom will schedule reconnection and trigger `onReconnectionCountdown` callback with number of milliseconds
to scheduled reconnection as argument, it will then trigger it every second. When countdown reaches 0 (callback is still called then) palindrom will try to reconnect (using `/reconnect` endpoint) to server. If this reconnection
fails then new reconnection will be scheduled for twice as many seconds (i.e. first it will occur after a seconds, then two seconds, then four, etc.). If reconnection succeeds, `onReconnectionEnd` callback will be triggered
and normal operations will continue.

For successful reconnection, palindrom sends a list of pending patches (those sent, but unconfirmed by server) to `/reconnect` endpoint and accepts a new state (along with version numbers) as a response. It then resets
to this new state and resumes its operations.

### Dependencies

It depends on Native [ES6 Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). Check usability on [caniuse](http://www.caniuse.com/#search=Proxy).

PalindromDOM
========

Extension to [Palindrom](#Palindrom) that adds DOM into two-way data binding chain (DOM ↔ local JSON ↔ remote JSON). Client side library that binds data on DOM level, so it integrates nicely with good old JavaScript, WebComponents, or Angular.

Implements [Server communication](https://github.com/Starcounter-Jack/Palindrom/wiki/Server-communication).

### Installation

#### You can install using [bower](http://bower.io/) and [NPM](http://npmjs.com/):

##### Bower:

```sh
bower install Palindrom --save
```

Then add source to your HTML:

```html
<!-- include Palindrom bundle -->
<script src="bower_components/Palindrom/dist/palindrom-dom.js"></script>
```
See [Dependencies section](https://github.com/Palindrom/Palindrom#dependencies) for more details.

##### NPM:

```sh
npm install palindrom --save
```

Then you can require it CommonJS or ES6/TS style:

###### CommonJS:
```js
var PalindromDOM = require('palindrom/src/palindrom-dom');
```

###### ES6/TS:
```js
import PalindromDOM from 'palindrom/src/palindrom-dom'
```

###### Or just download it manually from [github](https://github.com/Palindrom/Palindrom/archive/master.zip).

### Usage

After DOM is ready, initialize with the constructor:

```js
/**
 * Defines a connection to a remote PATCH server, gives an object that is persistent between browser and server
 */
var palindrom = new PalindromDOM({remoteUrl: window.location.href});
```

* *Note 1: Please make sure you pass the correct PATCH server URL.*
* *Note 2: `palindrom.obj` is only available after `options.onStateReset` is called.*

Now any changes to `palindrom.obj` will trigger a HTTP PATCH request. And any received will be applied.

### Demo

- [Example with Polymer's Template Binding and Web Components](http://Palindrom.github.io/Palindrom/lab/polymer/index.html)
- [Example with Vue](http://Palindrom.github.io/Palindrom/lab/vue/index.html)
- [Example with React](http://Palindrom.github.io/Palindrom/lab/react/index.html)

### Options (`PalindromDOM()` constructor parameters)

PalindromDOM accepts the same option attributes as Palindrom, plus the ones listed below. All the parameters are optional.

```javascript
var palindrom = new PalindromDOM({attribute: value});
```

Attribute           | Type          | Default                | Description
---                 | ---           | ---                    | ---
`listenTo`          | *HTMLElement* | `document.body`        | DOM node, that indicates a root of subtree to listen to events.

most of them are accessible also in runtime:

#### Properties

```javascript
palindrom.property
```
Property   | Type          | Default         | Description
---         | ---           | ---             | ---
`element`   | *HTMLElement* | `document.body` | See `listenTo` above
`listening` | *Boolean*     | `true`          | Is listening on

#### Methods

```javascript
palindrom.method()
```
Attribute   | Type          | Description
---         | ---           | ---
`unlisten`  | *HTMLElement* | Stop listening to DOM events
`listen`    | *HTMLElement* | Start listening to DOM events

### Browser history

Palindrom uses the HTML5 history API to update the URL in the browser address bar to reflect the new page. It also listens to a `popstate` event so it could ask the server for new JSON-Patch to morph the page back to previous state. Due to lack of native `pushstate` event you need to either:
 * call `palindrom.changeState(url)` after your `history.pushState(url)`,
 * call `palindrom.morph(url)` - that will call `pushState` and update palindrom's state for you,
 * trigger `palindrom-redirect-pushstate` with `{url: "/new/url"}` on `window` after your `history.pushState(url)`,
 * or use [`<palindrom-redirect>`](https://github.com/Palindrom/palindrom-redirect) Custom Element that does it for you.
